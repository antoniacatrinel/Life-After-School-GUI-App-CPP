# Life After School GUI Application

**GUI** version of https://github.com/antoniacatrinel/Life-After-School-Console-App-CPP using the **Qt 6.3.0** framework

***Requirements:***
- Implement the interface design (location and size of GUI widgets, without attached functionalities), without using the Qt Designer.
- The list or table displaying the repository entities in administrator mode should be populated using an input file.
- Add a filter for your repository and filter the elements according to any criteria you choose using the textChanged event of the QLineEdit. The elements are filtered by the substring in the line edit box above the list.
- Add a gradient to one of the widgets on your interface.
- Add multiple undo and redo functionality for the add, remove, and update operations. Implement this functionality using inheritance and polymorphism. You will have Undo and Redo buttons on the GUI, as well as a key combination to undo and redo the operations (e.g. Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y).
- Show the contents of the user event list using a table view. You must use the Qt View/Model components (QTableView). Create your own model â€“ a class which inherits from QAbstractTableModel. This window will be opened from your GUI main window.
